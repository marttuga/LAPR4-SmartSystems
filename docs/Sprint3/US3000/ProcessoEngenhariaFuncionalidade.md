# US3000
=======================================


# 1. Requirements

**US3000** As Project Manager, I want the team to specify a grammar allowing to express several kinds of questionnaires.

- The structure of the questionnaire must always be validated and adapted to the team's choice.

## Acceptance criteria

* The grammar should be conceived having in mind its reusability/applicability on other application domains than the one of 
this project (e.g., pedagogical questionnaires).
* Teams are free to adopt the format foreseen as best suitable for the project purposes.
Section 5.1.3 of the specifications' document provides a complete example of a questionnaire that all teams' solutions must support.
* There is no intend to reutilize questions and/or sections. If that happens, the user will type the question/section again.

# 2. Analysis
- The questionnaire should be developed according to the needs of each team. There are several types of questionnaires that 
can be made following a structure, and taking into account the indications given in the system specification document.
